   <h1>Reasons why I love animals</h1>
        <p>We love so many people in our lives, humans are, by nature, materialistic. And humans always expect, it's human tendency. But animals they never expect anything, they don't get angry at you when you ignore them because of your work, they don't get angry when you forgot their birthday. They'll love you the same.It has become very apparent that stress affects our mental and physical health and our world has become more stressful than ever. We live in a fast-paced world which demands our attention and can easily wear us out. There are certain methods to reduce stress, but one of the best is to own a pet. Pets provide support like a best friend because they are always available to listen (without judgement), which can help you unload after a hectic day.

Whether your preferred companion is a dog or a cat, talking out issues with hem can help you see the situation differently, let out some steam, and feel more relaxed. Moreover, when you are feeling stressed, there is nothing like a sweet pair of eyes that instantly attract your focus and help you get your mind off the thoughts and emotions that are causing the stress. Pets need to be handled, fed, and loved, so you don’t have time to sit and stew in a negative place; you have better things to do. People are not always around when you need them, but pets are. They are constantly giving off love and gratitude, and they are happy to be in your presence. You can be yourself around pets.

     <h1>Reasons for not having a pet</h1>
        <p>One drawback of getting a pet is an immediate increase in responsibility. Just like a young child, pets rely on you for absolutely everything. Not only that, if they have yet to be trained, they won’t understand your anger if they do something wrong. If you are someone with an over scheduled life, or doubt your children’s ability to step up to this responsibility, a small pet like a hamster or mouse might be a better first step.Another drawback to pets in the home are allergies. Especially if you don’t know what you’re allergic to, bringing a cat or a dog into your life can bring unexpected hurdles. Keep in mind that allergies grow worse each time you are exposed to an allergen, so spending limited time with animals in the past is not conclusive proof you aren’t allergic. If you’re unsure of your animal allergies, pet sitting for a friend or spending time volunteering for an animal shelter might be something you want to try first.Another important consideration when getting a pet is whether or not the animal in question brings more hazards to your life. A pet might be a fine addition for families with young kids, however a large breed of dog for example, will require extra attention and training to make sure it is safe around children. Similarly, aggressive types of snakes or territorial pets may not be the best addition if you have dependents living with you. It is important to consider the needs of everyone in your house before getting a pet.

<h1>But if yes, what animal to choose?</h1>
  <p>It all depends on what you want in a pet. All three are wonderful animals.

If you're looking for a pet who'll go everywhere with you, who will wish to please you as a member of your pack, and who will warn you of the arrival of visitors, get a dog. You must be prepared to walk your dog at least twice a day, and to clean up after him/her. You will also need to set firm and consistent boundaries for your dog's behavior, and enforce the rules. If you leave a dog alone too frequently, you may return to find that your bored companion has inflicted major damage on your home, so either adopt two dogs or see to it that your pet is usually occupied with work or play. No dog should be staked outside or chained up in a small enclosure for more than an hour or two, max, and never leave an animal in direct sun, a hot vehicle, or without fresh water. The people at the animal rescue shelters do the best they can to give the animals exercise in the (we hope) short period of time until adoption. They don't have much choice about keeping the dogs and cats kenneled. You do.

While we're on the subject, you do the world and yourself great good if you get your companion at a shelter, not from a pet store or breeder. A shelter animal will give you just as much joy and love, at a very modest price, as any high-priced “purebred” pet. Most important is spaying or neutering your pet so as not to add to the vast, sad oversupply of unwanted animals. A cat or dog is not a man. Please don't over-identify with your dog or tomcat. Nature makes some ultimately cruel demands on hormone/pheromone-driven animals that She doesn't insist upon with us humans. We're allowed a choice when it comes to mating; our intact pets are not.

If you want a pet that is relatively self-sufficient, who can be left alone for a day or two while you travel—along WITH, please, several clean litter boxes, a few untippable water dishes, and some dry kibble--a quieter pet who needs virtually no grooming and is affectionate without the big sloppy kisses that canines sometimes bestow on us, then adopt a cat (preferably a short-haired variety who seldom needs brushing, unless you have the time and inclination to apply daily grooming). It's best to bring home two cats from the same litter, or a mellow male and female couple, than to introduce a second cat to your household later. Cats are instinctively territorial. Sometimes one (usually the first feline resident) simply will not accept a newcomer. A kitten generally takes one (or even two to three!) years to mature enough to be left alone for long periods, and if a kitten doesn't have a playmate, YOU are in charge of the necessary entertainment until your young cat is past its getting-into-everything phase. Both dogs and cats will occasionally scratch you by accident. You do have to be more careful when dealing with feline claws than with canine nails, but you can also have claws and nails trimmed regularly. My experience with injuries from dog paws is that wearing shoes at all times is a good preventive measure!

If you can spend a lot of time with an animal who'll bond with you so closely that he or she will see you as a mate substitute, then go for a bird. Remember, though, that some parrots live up to 75 years and would grieve deeply upon losing your company. Do your best to take in a bird that probably can't be expected to outlive you by decades. Birds have very little sphinter control and can't humanely be kept in a cage at all times. If the mess caused by bird droppings, fruit peels, and flying seed shells is likely to be a major annoyance, think twice about a pet bird. Then consider psittacine temperament. Years ago a friend had a small, green, Senegalese parrot that was reliably gentle with her, but--as the bird grew old and cranky--would aggressively attack anyone else who came within reach. Bird beaks can be weapons, too, and all our pets are capable of bad behavior that springs from jealousy. I could tell a tale about a jealous pet rabbit, but that's enough from me for now.</p>
